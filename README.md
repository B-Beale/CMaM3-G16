# CMaM3-G16
Repository for group 16's project

## Goal
We intend to recreate the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou experiment.

## Things To Note
Right now, there are two files that will run the simulation, 
funtion oriented programming.py and simulator.py, the former is considerably better written and I plan on removing simulator.py once I'm certain it doesn't contain anything useful.

The speed of the program is very slow right now, so if you are going to run the program, either change the dt value to something higher or be willing to wait a while for things to happen

## What more needs to be done
There is a file in this github repository called to-do list, this is a non-exhaustive list of improvements that need to be made.
