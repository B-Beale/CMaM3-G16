A quick to do list of things that need to be done

Complete Code
    - Set up user interface
        - Add initial velocity and displacement options
    - perform a modal analysis
        - Fourier Transforms
    - plot the time evolution of the amplitude of first modes
    - implement a more accurate numerical derivation method (Runge Kutta)
    - Comment the code to improve clarity
    - Remove Bloat
    - Make the code easy to use
        - Offer comments to help printing for understanding of code
    - etc

Report
Report part A/B compared to results in slides
Report part C/D Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou with reference to parts ABC
(maybe Report part E)

Extra (Part E)
    - Consider Tolerances
